Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) \n",
    " 'is overabundant in CRC and associated with metastasis, but the role of F. nucleatum in CRC cell migration and metastasis has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: Differential gene analysis, protein-protein interaction, robust rank aggregation analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and gene set variation analysis were used to figure out the potential vital genes and biological functions affected by F. nucleatum infection. The 16S rDNA sequencing and q-PCR were used to detect the abundance of F. nucleatum in tissues and stools. Then, we assessed the effect of F. nucleatum on CRC cell migration by wound healing and transwell assays, and confirmed \n",
    " the role of Matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) induced by F. nucleatum in cell migration.\n",
    " Furthermore, we dissected the mechanisms involved in F. nucleatum induced MMP7 expression.\n",
    " We also investigated the MMP7 expression in clinical samples and its correlation with prognosi\n",
    " in CRC patients. Finally, we screened out potential small molecular drugs that targeted MMP7 using the HERB \n",
    " database and molecular docking. RESULTS: F. nucleatum infection altered the gene expression profile and affected immune response, \n",
    " inflammation, biosynthesis, metabolism, adhesion and motility related biological functions in CRC. F. nucleatum was enriched in CRC \n",
    " and promoted the migration of CRC cell by upregulating MMP7 in vitro. MMP7 expression induced by F. nucleatum infection was mediated\n",
    " by the MAPK(JNK)-AP1 axis. MMP7 was highly expressed in CRC and correlated with CMS4 and poor clinical prognosis. Small molecular \n",
    " drugs such as delta-tocotrienol, 3,4-benzopyrene, tea polyphenols, and gallic catechin served as potential targeted therapeutic drugs \n",
    " for F. nucleatum induced MMP7 in CRC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that F. nucleatum promoted metastasis-related characteristics of \n",
    " CRC cell by upregulating MMP7 via MAPK(JNK)-AP1 axis. F. nucleatum and MMP7 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for repressing \n",
